       <hr>
    <p>  Addictive disorders disrupt relationships with family
and friends and often cause people to lose their jobs. For people who are already struggling to pay their
bills, the onset or exacerbation of an addiction may cause them to lose their housing<br><br>the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (2003) estimates, 38% of homeless people were dependent on alcohol and 26% abused
other drugs. Alcohol abuse is more common in older generations, while drug abuse is more common in

among homeless people than in the general population. According to the 2006 National Household
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 15% of people above the age of 12 reported using drugs
within the past year and only 8% reported using drugs within the past month

           <p> 
The city identified 7,008 homeless young people in 2019 and 6,753 in 2020. Advocates say those numbers are likely significant undercounts. The city's Continuum of Care, a coalition of people experiencing homelessness, providers, advocates and government agencies, will next develop an action plan to submit to HUD.
